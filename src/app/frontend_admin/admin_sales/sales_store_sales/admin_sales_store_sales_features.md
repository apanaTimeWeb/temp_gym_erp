# Admin Store sales — Autonomous Submodule Specification


> **Canonical-only frontend routing:** this module supports only its canonical route(s) in the role map. Retired frontend path aliases, catch-all dispatchers, duplicate route trees, and compatibility redirects are removed. Former frontend paths do not redirect. Domain-root `page.tsx` retains only the architecture-required redirect to its default canonical leaf. Backend API URL literals and verified request/response contracts are unchanged.


> Derived from the supplied Admin role module source and the approved V2.11 decomposition plan. External API/host contracts are not inferred.

## 1. Scope and Non-Scope

**Owning capability:** Store sales within the Admin Sales domain. This leaf is a direct child of `admin_sales/` and is the autonomous route for the `store_sales` workflow.

**In scope:** this leaf’s route entry, workflow component(s), locally copied hooks/API/types/schemas, mock scenario and tests described in the source inventory. **Out of scope:** sibling leaf business code, host-global infrastructure, and unverified backend behavior.

## 2. Screen Inventory

- Route: `/frontend_admin/admin_sales/sales_store_sales`.
- Main capability: `Store sales`.
- Primary view source: `components/store_sales/AdminSalesStoreSalesStoreSales.tsx` (derived from the pre-split module source).
- Loading/error/not-found route entries remain co-located.

## 3. Navigation Contract
- **Canonical route:** `/frontend_admin/admin_sales/sales_store_sales`.
- **Owning domain:** `admin_sales/`; this leaf is exposed by its domain's secondary navigation.
- **Routing rule:** this leaf has no compatibility alias or legacy redirect. The parent domain root retains only its architecture-required default redirect to its first canonical leaf.
## 4. API Contract

- `storeOrders` — source evidence: `storeOrders: ADMIN_SALES_STORE_ORDERS_URL,`
- `storeSummary` — source evidence: `storeSummary: ADMIN_SALES_STORE_SUMMARY_URL,`

## 5. Query Key Registry

Query keys remain module-prefixed and are defined in this leaf’s `constants/` category. Only the scoped workflow query is enabled by this leaf-local logic; shared summary/current-context queries are explicitly called out in the implementation. Verify exact keys from the listed `*QueryKeys.ts` file.

## 6. Mutation Inventory

Mutation methods and their payloads are copied from the source module only where imported by this workflow. No endpoint, HTTP method, request parameter, response field, or business invariant is added by this decomposition. State-changing calls must keep the existing UUIDv4 `Idempotency-Key` flow.

## 7. Permissions and Role Rules

Permission and role checks are inherited from the source components/hooks and are not expanded by this move. If the source ZIP does not contain a permission contract for a control, that contract remains `NOT_VERIFIED`; this document does not invent a permission matrix.

## 8. State Ownership

Server data is managed by TanStack Query v5 in leaf-local hooks/API code. URL-backed state remains in Next.js search parameters; transient modal/form state remains in the leaf-local Zustand store and RHF/Zod hooks where present.

## 9. Offline and Reconnect Behavior

The leaf ships local MSW handler/fixture/scenario sources. Runtime offline/reconnect behavior is only claimed where the source hooks define it; network execution is `DEFERRED_TO_HOST_RUNTIME`.

## 10. Security and PII Rules

The decomposition preserves existing masking, nullable-value display, authorization boundaries, tenant identity source, and redaction code by copying those dependency files into the leaf. Do not place business entity records in browser storage or expose client secrets.

## 11. Accessibility Requirements

Interactive controls must retain semantic labels, keyboard operation, focus-visible indicators, live pending/error states, and WCAG 2.2 AA touch-target/contrast requirements. Existing component markup is preserved except for route/workflow ownership and file-path changes.

## 12. Background Tasks

No new background job or scheduler is introduced by this split. Any asynchronous refresh remains owned by the copied query/mutation hook.

## 13. Feature Flags

No new feature flag is invented. A flag is considered present only if a concrete key and its evaluation are found in the supplied source.

## 14. Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation/query-key behavior is retained from the source module’s hook and mutation implementations. Any behavior not statically traceable is `NOT_VERIFIED` rather than inferred.

## 15. Migration and Rollback

- **Migration scope:** This is a frontend feature contract. The supplied source does not establish a database/schema migration or a backend deployment migration for this leaf; do not infer or apply one from this document.
- **Forward change procedure:** Keep changes within this leaf's existing route, API-client, schema/type, hook, UI, locale, mock, and test ownership boundaries. Preserve the canonical URL configuration and all verified request/response behavior. Update source-derived inventory and regression coverage together when ownership changes.
- **Rollback procedure:** Revert the coordinated leaf-owned frontend changes as one unit, including related locale and test updates. Do not restore retired route aliases, stale imports, or undocumented backend contracts as part of rollback.
- **Verification gate:** Resolve leaf-local imports and physical inventory references; parse changed locale JSON and syntax-check changed TypeScript/TSX; run the host typecheck, tests, build, and route/browser checks when the host project environment is available. Those host checks are not claimed as run by this documentation repair.
- **Data safety:** No production data mutation or backend migration is authorized by this section. Any such operation requires a separately supplied, authoritative backend change plan.

## 16. Test Coverage Map

Co-located test sources verified in this leaf:
- `tests/api/AdminSalesStoreSalesFeatureUrlContract.test.ts`
- `tests/hooks/useAdminSalesStoreSalesLogic.test.ts`
- `tests/utils/AdminSalesStoreSalesApiResponse.test.ts`
- `tests/utils/AdminSalesStoreSalesDateRangeUtils.test.ts`
- `tests/utils/AdminSalesStoreSalesFormatters.test.ts`

Test execution requires the host package manifest, installed test runner/dependencies, and authenticated runtime. Integrated execution is `DEFERRED_TO_HOST_RUNTIME` for this isolated role ZIP.

## 17. Architecture Exceptions

This leaf contains no business imports from sibling leaves. Global dependencies are limited to the approved host infrastructure and zero-business UI primitives. The role navigation shell is owned by `admin_navigation/` and is not a leaf feature dependency. The source module was split by independently navigable tab/workflow and documented endpoint families.

## 18. Known Contract Gaps

Known source conflicts and external contract gaps are recorded in `audit_evidence/ADMIN_V47_API_CONTRACT_PRESERVATION.csv`. The two flagged URL literals remain unchanged pending authoritative contract evidence; Data Export and dedicated 2FA lifecycle behavior are not invented. The host `apiFetch` implementation and public rewrite layer are outside this role ZIP, so integrated envelope and public-route behavior remain `DEFERRED_TO_HOST_RUNTIME` or `NOT_VERIFIED_IN_SCOPE`.

## 19. Rule Compliance Checklist

Evidence classifications are `VERIFIED`, `DERIVED`, `CONTRACT_MISSING`, or `NOT_VERIFIED`. No source/API claim is elevated to `VERIFIED` solely because a folder or documentation file exists.

## 20. Standalone Run, Mock & Test Harness

`contracts/host-stubs.d.ts`, `tests/harness/bootstrap.ts`, a provider harness, mutable module-owned MSW fixtures/handlers, and at least one local API route contract test are included. The host must provide the documented shared infrastructure stubs/dependencies.

## 21. Module Portability & Host Integration Guide

This module is designed for extraction into the canonical role container. Integration requires Next.js App Router, TypeScript path alias `@/*`, approved core API/logger/UI/socket/display helpers, and the package versions recorded in host configuration. Host config files are outside the supplied role ZIP.

## 22. Deliverables & Version History

Updated during Admin v45 domain-grouping and ownership reconciliation. Canonical route and file references are checked against the final physical tree; backend endpoint literals remain source-defined and any unresolved external contract is called out in the release evidence.

### RBG 21–23 audit-repair addendum
Store Sales mock applies canonical preset date windows; disclosure aria-controls only references a mounted detail region.

### RBG 28–30 route error safety correction
- Forbidden-page selection now uses the explicit numeric `error.status === 403` signal only. Error-message text containing `403` does not establish authorization status.
- The forbidden destination link has a minimum 44px hit area (`min-h-11`), preserving the existing navigation URL and approved semantic theme tokens. Backend enforcement remains authoritative and requires host verification.


### Admin v51 RBG 33 — API validation path safety (2026-11-01)

Canonical HTTP 400 `validationErrors` are mapped to React Hook Form only when each segment of the supplied field path exists as an own property of the current form values. Unknown nested paths, prototype names and missing array indices are not mapped. Valid root, nested and existing indexed paths remain supported. Other affected leaves retain their documented exact-field validation contract; verification evidence is in `audit_evidence/ADMIN_V51_RBG33_FIELD_PATH_LEDGER.csv`. This is source-level behavior, not executed Vitest/host certification.

#### RBG 67 — mock pagination guard
The existing mock list route retains default page 1 and limit 10, rejects malformed numeric text, and caps mock limit at 100. Independent module-owned parsing prevents nonfinite, fractional and unsafe mock offsets. This does not modify the production backend endpoint or envelope.

#### RBG 69 — URL pagination boundary
The URL page reader and outbound page setter use the same module-owned strict positive-integer guard. Malformed inputs, fractions and nonfinite values fall back to page 1, and page values above 100000 are bounded to avoid unbounded requests. API endpoints, filters, sorting, and returned query envelopes are unchanged.

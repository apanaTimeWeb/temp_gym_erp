# Subscriptions Invoices — Forbidden Patterns — `admin/subscriptions`

## 1. No Client-Side Full-Table Fetch
**FORBIDDEN:** Fetching all subscriptions and paginating on the client.
**ALLOWED:** Always pass `page` + `limit` params to the API.

## 2. Critical Subscription Mutations Require Confirmation + Idempotency
**FORBIDDEN:** Executing upgrade, auto-renew, or payment-method removal without the confirmation boundary and idempotency-key contract.
**ALLOWED:** Confirm the exact user intent first, generate one idempotency key for that intent, and reuse it for retries.

## 3. No Hardcoded Status Styles / No Cross-Role Imports / No Barrel Files
Standard rules apply.

## Canonical Sub-Module Isolation Invariants (Architecture Rule 40)

These constraints apply to this leaf in addition to the feature-specific prohibitions above. The canonical rule authority remains `WEB_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DEVELOPMENT_RULES_V1.md`, Rule 40; this list makes the local boundary explicit without changing that authority.

1. **Zero cross-sub-module business imports:** do not import sibling leaf components, hooks, stores, types, schemas, utilities, fixtures, or handlers.
2. **Zero parent shared folders:** do not create or consume parent `common/`, `shared/`, or business-aware `components/` folders.
3. **Strict WET isolation:** duplicate business-specific badges, filters, formatters, and UI patterns locally when sharing them would couple leaves.
4. **Zero cross-sub-module in-memory state:** do not share React Context, Zustand stores, or mutable business objects with sibling leaves; use documented URL navigation and typed query parameters where approved.
5. **Local fixture ownership:** keep this leaf's fixtures, MSW handlers, scenarios, and mock tests inside this leaf's `mocks/` and `tests/` directories.
6. **No duplicate global mock handlers:** do not register a second global handler for a leaf-owned endpoint or scenario.
7. **No sibling fixture imports:** do not import sample data or scenario factories owned by another business leaf.
8. **No fake business fallbacks:** do not fabricate records, statuses, IDs, amounts, permissions, or success responses to disguise missing API contracts.
9. **API boundary only:** UI components must not bypass the leaf API client to read fixtures directly or call backend endpoints ad hoc.
10. **No casual global MSW changes:** do not modify the role-wide MSW bootstrap for a leaf-local change unless registration is explicitly required by the existing harness contract.
- FORBIDDEN: frontend compatibility redirects and alias maps; use canonical routes only.
